# GMIT PFDA TRIALS
A place to store my work-throughs on the weekly lectures

## Week 1
No work this week - just get all the software up to date

## Week 2
Week 02 folder contains all the data pertaining to the videos from week 2. I followed down through the videos and did the plots to make sure I could replicate Ian's work. 
* 2dplot.py - in this file I worked through the scatter plot examples shown in the videos
* histo.py - in this file I worked through the histogram plot examples in the video - from stack exchange I learned how to set the axis limits (so visually compare the 2 distributions when side by side), also I played around with putting more that 2 sub plots on the plot together 
* scatter.py - this is just a copy of the code that Ian presented - 'c' is the color of the marker, 's' is the size - so we can plot 4 dimensions on a 2d plot
* sin.py - this is the sin and cos functions plotted on the same axis as per the video - I added a legend so we can tell them apart
* powers.py - this is the powers plotted as per the video - as an extra I redid it for differnt value ranges and plotted them as sub plot
